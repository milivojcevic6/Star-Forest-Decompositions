# Abstract
We deal with the problem of decomposing a complete geometric graph into plane star-forests. In particular, we disprove a recent conjecture by Pach, Saghafian and Schnider by constructing for each even $n$ a complete geometric graph on $n$ vertices which can be decomposed into $\frac{n}{2}+1$ plane star-forests. Additionally we prove that for complete abstract graphs a decomposition into plane star-forests is composed of a matching and $\frac{n}{2}$ star-forests with 2 edge-balanced components, which we call broken double stars. 
# The Structure of Project
The entirety of the project was done using Google Colab, and therefore consists of multiple Jupyter Notebooks. The best way to read all of it is:
1. file `star_forests_6_points.ipynb`, describing the process of finding all star-forest decompositions of 6-point sets, as well as generating pictures which describe them.
2. file `star_forests_8_points.ipynb`, describing the process of finding all star-forest decompositions of 8-point sets.
3. file `star_forests_8_pics.ipynb`, generating pictures of the decompostions of 8-point sets. 
# Notes
1. The pre-print of the paper this data is used in will soon be published on arxiv.
2. For transparency, we also include the file `8-5-partitions.txt`, where we stored the point sets of size 8 which admit star-forest decompositions, as well as one example partition for each of them. They are also displayed in `star_forests_8_pics.ipynb`.
3. As the ```star_forests_8_pics.ipynb``` file is currently too large to be displayed on `github`, we recommend opening it using `github.dev`. Here is how to do this:
