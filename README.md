# Star-Forest-Decompositions
We deal with the problem of decomposing a complete geometric graph into planar star-forests. In2 particular, we disprove a recent conjecture by Pach, Saghafian and Schnider by constructing an3 infinite family of complete geometric graphs on n vertices which can be decomposed into 2n 3 star4 forests
