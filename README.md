# Star-Forest-Decompositions
We deal with the problem of decomposing a complete geometric graph into plane star-forests. In particular, we disprove a recent conjecture by Pach, Saghafian and Schnider by constructing for each even $n$ a complete geometric graph on $n$ vertices which can be decomposed into $\frac{n}{2}+1$ plane star-forests. Additionally we prove that for complete abstract graphs a decomposition into plane star-forests is composed of a matching and $\frac{n}{2}$ star-forests with 2 edge-balanced components, which we call broken double stars.
